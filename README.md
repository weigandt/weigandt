## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**weigandt/weigandt** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

ğŸ”­ I'm currently teaching Statistics and Calculus II at Lorain County Community College.
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to write accesssbile documents using PreTeXt, which is like the Universal Cover of LaTeX and html, as I understand it.
ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on lots of Mathematics projects. I never entirely quit doing mathematics, but I am very interested in finding the time to get back into serious mathematics research.
ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning to get things done without bifurcating into ennumerable non-achievments.
ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
ğŸ“« How to reach me: weigandt37@gmail.com is a good contact.
âš¡ Fun fact: Maybe later.
